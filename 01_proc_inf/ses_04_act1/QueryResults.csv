A more common convention might be to return an `NSError` where `nil` means there was no error (and thus completed successfully) and something else would mean that it stopped due to an error, but more importantly, why it failed. When dealing with multiple levels like this, the original calling routine might want to know why it didn't succeed (e.g. no Internet connectivity, some authentication error, etc.).

"I'm with @user1844933 - use ""soft deletes"" (flag as deleted) instead of actually deleting the row.  After that, don't store the backup queue in the DB, just client-side; things like tags/folder location are based on ids, so you only need to deal with 3/4 pieces of data (per item) - command (`""move""`), id of item affected (`34`), and other (source folder id/destination folder id, tag id, etc).  Only stick this in a table if you want to persist it between sessions/across devices - and don't do this as SQL: if it's agnostic, you can switch to a different system if necessary.","21494682","","2014-02-02 05:30:35","0"

The right-hand side of an `await` expression can be any type of value, if it is not a Promise, then it will be converted to a resolved Promise.

"It sounds like you think the OP's problem is an attempt to write back to the same file that is being read - it is not, because the command in the question writes to a _different_ file (`*.txt`). As for why: The pipeline _streams_ (processes input object by object), so the write command tries to write lines to a file that is _still open_, because the read command (`Get-Content`) hasn't finished reading it yet. A simple workaround is to enclose the `Get-Content` call in `(...)`, which forces reading _up front_: `(Get-Content ...) | ... | Set-Content ...`.

For a while I wondered the same thing and it only dawned on me after seeing a simple console application with a menu in a text book. The last option in the menu was ""Exit Program"". The last action of the program was to close, thus ""Return 0;"" in the main was the line of code that was executed. When there isn't a pause of some kind while programming such things, you don't actually see what your code does because the console closes so quickly.","35593349","","2019-08-21 19:12:41","0"

I just wanted to be able to `concat` together actual function calls with the `message$` Observable and have them all execute in series, as such: `return concat(showTyping(), message$, hideTyping()).pipe(delay(2000));`.

"""which part of the program indicates this space complexity."" - well, since it says _space_ complexity it's probably `new boolean[len][len]`, i.e. a 2D array of `n * n` elements.

In practice, instructions may be reordered for speed and/or execute in parallel, as long as a C++ programs can't spot it using pure C++. And since the C++ standard doesn't _fully_ specify causality, implementations may take advantage of that.

In any case, if you have your vertex positions stored in a texture, you can do multiple fetches in a fragment shader (you will have to use the texture coordinate indexing logic from the Three.js example I linked earlier to fetch the vertices from the right texel) and probably implement the entire thing on the GPU.","29054853","","2015-03-15 02:37:56","0"

A NotificationSource is an object that will notify registered NotificationSink objects when a
particular event happens. The idea is that NotificationSource objects are used on remote
machines to monitor the behaviour of certain components of a distributed system and to send
Notifications whenever particular events happen.

every time the monitored event happens.

A Notification object is used to hold information about an event when it happens.","5666852","","2011-04-14 17:05:13","0"

If your own code changes something that causes a need to update the drawing, you call `Invalidate()` and then wait for the framework to raise the `Paint` event so that you can draw.

Class members belong to classes, and must be instantiated through the class as a type... they are a *property* of a variable declared with that class type while not being variables themselves. Think of classes as a schematic for making variables; if you declare a class but never make an instance, no variables (besides statics). You can apply things like `private` or `protected` or `public` to them, but you cannot declare a private local variable.  A class instance, declared as a variable, may be local or global.","29056640","","2015-03-15 03:48:04","1"
